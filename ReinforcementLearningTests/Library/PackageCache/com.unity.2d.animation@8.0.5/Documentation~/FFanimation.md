# Frame-by-frame animation

By using [Sprite Swap](SpriteSwapIntro.md), you can create frame-by-frame style animations by swapping to different Sprites on each frame at runtime. This is useful for simple animations, such as to show a character blinking. The following steps assume that you have a working knowledge of the [Sprite Library Asset](SLAsset.md) features.

1. Create a Sprite Library Asset and add a new **Category**.

2. Add the Sprite for each frame of the animation to this **Category**, and give each of the Sprites a unique **Label** name.

3. Create a GameObject and add the [Sprite Renderer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteRenderer.html) component to it, then add the [Sprite Resolver](SLAsset.md#sprite-resolver-component) component to it.

4. Open the [Animation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationOverview.html) window, and select the GameObject from step 3. Create a new [Animation Clip](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/animeditor-CreatingANewAnimationClip.html) if required.

5. Enable [keyframe recording](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/animeditor-AnimatingAGameObject.html) in the Animation Window.<br/>![](images/2d-anim-ffanim-keyframe-recording.png)

6. Go to the Sprite Resolverâ€™s Inspector window, and select the **Category** and **Label** for the Sprite that you want to start the animation clip from.<br/>![](images/2d-anim-sprite-resolver-example.png). The selected Sprite is recorded to that keyframe.

7. Repeat step 6 by replacing the Sprite with the next one in sequence. By changing the **Category** and **Label** values of in Sprite Resolver, the frame-by-frame animation style is simulated.
